Tom Kurzeka is a product designer crafting experiences for web, iOS, & Android. His design perspective has three pillars: empathy, utility, & delight.

Tom is an endlessly curious, critical thinker who thrives in ambiguity. With experience on both small startup teams and large cross-functional squads, he adapts his design process to address the challenges, constraints, and business needs at hand. 

Tom’s favorite part of the design process is creating—wireframe iterations, visual design explorations, rapid prototyping, and exploring interaction patterns. His happy place is the intersection of brand identity, interaction design, and visual polish.

He is an adept moderator and research planner, having conducted everything from guerrilla user research, in-house usability studies, and remote moderated sessions with tools like UserTesting.com.

Tom has helped create, maintain, and grow design systems and has experience adapting original ideas to work within an existing design system. 

In his free time, Tom reads deeply about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data, including the works of Melanie Mitchell, Douglas Hofstader, and Shoshana Zubinoff. 

He is familiar with generative AI tools like Chat GPT, Dall-E, Midjourney, and Adobe Firefly. In 2022, I completed multiple courses in Python to better understand these emerging technologies.
