title: Melodicus, another YouTube looper
preview: Designing and building a better way to learn songs by ear

A quick search for “YouTube looper” will yield a number sites named in the spirit of wordplay. LoopTube, Looper.tube, RepeatTube, YouTube. You get the point. 

Many of these, I presume, are side projects just like mine. What I found interesting was that most of them are not specific about the use case for looping a video. 

Playing an entire video or a portion of a video on repeat has a host of utilities that cut across everyday needs - education, humor, entertainment, etc. Instead of identifying one of these problem spaces and presenting a looper as a solution to it, most of the sites I discovered present the looper utility with paragraphs of text beneath it explaining how it might be useful in various contexts.

My primary motivation in designing and building my YouTube looper — Melodicus — is that I struggle to learn guitar parts by ear. Other, more efficient avenues exist, but they don’t strengthen my inner ear the same way learning directly from the source does. 

Moreover, I wanted an application that would be especially useable on my iPad, which I typically have resting on a music stand in the corner of my apartment dedicated to a couple guitars, amps, pedals, and too many music books.

Adjacent motivations for this project include teaching myself React, using a new UI library (Chakra UI), and thinking about a common utility from a product lens.

Without further ado, I present the MVP of [Melodicus.](https://melodicus.vercel.app)
