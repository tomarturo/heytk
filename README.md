My product design portfolio with a chat interface

## Always learning
I made a number of chat prototypes with Streamlit and embedded them in my old portfolio site, which was built on Webflow. Increasingly frustrated with my inability to style the Streamlit iframe to my liking, I decided to build a new portfolio from scratch. 

## Why Python?
I started working in Python because I have some experience with it and my initial research on custom chatbots led me to Langchain. After struggling to get the results I wanted from a Langchain + OpenAI embeddings approach, I realized I could accomplish what I needed with an extensive prompt working directly with the OpenAi API. 

I needed to start applying for jobs and didn't want to undo the work I had done getting this running and hosted as a Flask app on PythonAnywhere, so it remains a Flask app, even though I now know I don't need Python to accomplish my end result ðŸ¤·.

## What to learn next?
I'm hoping to move into a design engineering or creative technologist role and I'd like to keep this project going as a artifact for future applications. Some ideas I'm thinking of tackling next:
- adding a blog section for experiments and explorations
- digging into the OpenAI API and leveraging embeddings and sentiment analysis
- rewriting the site in React and migrating to Vercel (to save myself the $5/month charge from PythonAnywhere, among other things)
- creating a clean Figma file of the design, componetizing it, and doing a design system exercise (would probably be most useful if I did this in conjunction with the above option)
